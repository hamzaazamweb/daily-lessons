ðŸ”§ System Breakdown Story (and Kafka Rescue)
The Problem:
Their backend collapsed as payments succeeded but confirmations failed.

All tasks (verifying, emailing, logging, notifying, etc.) ran synchronously in a single API call.

If any step failed (like email), the whole flow broke, leading to:

Duplicate charges

No receipts

Overwhelmed support

It wasnâ€™t a bug â€” it was a design flaw: too much coupling.

The Realization:
The core payment action should be fast and independent.

Non-critical tasks (email, notifications, analytics) should not block payment success.

Enter Kafka â€” a message broker to decouple responsibilities.

Kafka Implementation:
After a payment: publish a payment_success event to Kafka.

Services like email, fraud detection, logging became Kafka consumers.

If any service is down, Kafka holds the message until itâ€™s ready.

Results:
System became faster and more reliable.

Support tickets dropped.

Scaling became easier: add more consumers as needed.

New features (like cashback, SMS) didnâ€™t require touching core logic.

Key Benefits Kafka Gave Them:
Speed

Reliability

Scalability

Peace of mind â€” services now work like independent teammates.

ðŸ’¡ Lessons for System Design Interviews (HLD/LLD):
Design for decoupling: isolate critical path (e.g., payment).

Use event-driven architecture for async tasks.

Kafka (or similar) helps build resilient, scalable systems.

Think producer-consumer pattern with fail-safe mechanisms.

Bottom line:

Donâ€™t chain everything inside one API call. Publish an event and let others react. Kafka turned a fragile system into a scalable, fault-tolerant architecture.
