## 🚀 Overview

Explaining technical ideas to non-technical people is a vital skill for developers. Whether you're working with clients, managers, sales teams, or general audiences, your ability to simplify and clarify complex topics can determine your success.

This guide introduces the **Communication Iceberg**—a model filled with practical tools to abstract complexity and connect better with non-technical audiences.

## 🔹 General Tips (Top of the Iceberg)

✅ **Use Analogies**  
Compare technical concepts to everyday examples (e.g., servers = restaurant waiters).

✅ **Avoid Jargon & Acronyms**  
Replace technical terms with plain language wherever possible.

✅ **Explain Visually**  
Use flowcharts, diagrams, and illustrations instead of lengthy text.

✅ **Use Storytelling**  
Frame explanations as narratives (e.g., version control = team sharing & tracking changes).

✅ **Start with the Big Picture**  
Ease into the topic instead of diving straight into details.

✅ **Encourage Questions**  
Create a two-way conversation to promote engagement and clarity.
