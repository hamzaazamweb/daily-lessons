# 🧑‍💻 Problem Solving for Developers — Lessons from the Sticker Story

The video tells the story of a developer who promised to send stickers to anyone submitting a pull request, which led to **600+ pull requests** needing to be reviewed and merged. 

Instead of manually clicking merge buttons, they used this as a teaching moment to explain how **software developers solve problems efficiently**.

## 🧠 Core Message

**Problem solving is the #1 skill for developers.**  
It’s not about memorizing syntax, but about how you **approach, break down, and solve problems using code**.

---

## 🛠️ 7 Key Problem Solving Concepts  
*(Using the Sticker Story as an Example)*

### 1. Understand the Problem Deeply
- Clarify the context, reasons, and the value of solving the issue.  
- **Example:** Merging 600 PRs manually is tedious and inefficient.

---

### 2. Research & Refine
- Look for existing solutions, ask other developers, and explore APIs/tools.  
- **Example:** Explore GitHub API, validate logic, collaborate on ideas.

---

### 3. Pseudocode First
- Write a plan or outline before diving into code.  
- Helps you organize logic and naming without worrying about syntax.

---

### 4. Explore the Tools
- Understand the APIs you'll use (e.g., GitHub GraphQL) and their capabilities/limitations **before** implementation.

---

### 5. Use Test-Driven Development *(Optional but Powerful)*
- Write tests **before** you write your code.  
- Clarify expected behavior and catch bugs early.

---

### 6. Quick Implementation
- Build a working prototype **fast**.  
- Don’t try to make it perfect on the first try—validate your approach first.

---

### 7. Refactor & Reflect
- Once your code works:
  - Improve readability and naming
  - Add error handling
  - Optimize performance
  - Remove duplication

---

## 💡 Final Takeaways

- **Problem solving is a lifelong learning skill.**  
- You improve through doing, failing, reflecting, and repeating.
- Get feedback from more experienced developers.
- Programming is not just typing — it’s **clear thinking**.
