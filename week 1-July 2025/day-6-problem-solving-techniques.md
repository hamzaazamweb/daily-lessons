# 📘 Problem Solving Techniques Summary

This document summarizes key problem analysis and root cause techniques used across business, engineering, software, and product development.

## 🔍 1. FMEA (Failure Modes and Effects Analysis)

**Purpose**: Proactively identify potential failures and assess their risk.

**Steps**:
1. Identify all possible **failure modes** in a process or product.
2. Analyze their **effects** and **causes**.
3. Rate each on:
   - **Severity (S)**
   - **Occurrence (O)**
   - **Detection (D)**
4. Calculate **Risk Priority Number (RPN)**:

5. Prioritize actions based on RPN scores.

**Use When**:
- Preventing issues in product design or operations.
- Risk management in critical systems.

## 🐟 2. Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa)

**Purpose**: Identify and categorize root causes of a problem visually.

**Steps**:
1. Write the problem at the “head” of the fish.
2. Identify **major categories** of causes (e.g., People, Process, Tech, Data).
3. Brainstorm possible sub-causes under each category.
4. Analyze patterns and root contributors.

**Use When**:
- Problems are complex with many possible causes.
- Team-based root cause analysis.

## 🧠 3. 5 Whys Technique

**Purpose**: Find the **root cause** of a problem by asking “why” repeatedly.

**Steps**:
1. Clearly state the problem.
2. Ask “Why did this happen?” → record the answer.
3. Repeat asking “Why?” based on the previous answer.
4. Stop when the root cause is found (usually after 5 iterations).

**Use When**:
- Issues keep recurring.
- Quick root cause discovery is needed.

## 📊 4. Pareto Analysis (80/20 Rule)

**Purpose**: Prioritize the most impactful problems using the **80/20 rule**.

**Steps**:
1. List problems or causes.
2. Measure frequency or impact.
3. Sort in descending order.
4. Calculate cumulative percentages.
5. Focus on top 20% causes that result in 80% of the effect.

**Use When**:
- You have limited resources and need to focus on high-impact issues.

## 🔍 5. Situation Analysis

**Purpose**: Understand the current state before planning or solving.

**Steps**:
1. Define the objective or issue.
2. Gather relevant internal and external data.
3. Use frameworks like:
- **SWOT** (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)
- **PESTLE** (Political, Economic, Social, Tech, Legal, Environmental)
4. Identify insights, risks, and gaps.

**Use When**:
- Starting a new project or evaluating a problem environment.

## 🧱 6. Drill Down Technique

**Purpose**: Break a broad problem into smaller, more manageable parts.

**Steps**:
1. Start with a general issue.
2. Ask deeper questions or divide it into sub-problems.
3. Continue breaking down until you reach actionable, specific causes.

**Use When**:
- The problem is vague or large in scope.
- You want clarity and actionable detail.
